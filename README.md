# trade_a_day
The script will let you choose how much you want to trade daily on binance and it will select the best moment in the day to buy.

*best moment* simply means when the pair percent change is dropping to a certain threshold you define. If the criteria is not fullfilled during the day it will double (or multiplied by the number of skipped day) the amount of the trade the next day.

# Requirements
Binance account
Enough money $$$ to make the trade
